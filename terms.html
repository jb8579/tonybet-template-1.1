                                <p>3.1.2. The bonus offer for one customer Account shall be applicable only once, unless specific T&amp;Cs provide otherwise. Any bonus offer from the Operator is valid only one time per Customer account, computer, household, IP address
                                    and other places with a shared computer (office, library, university, etc.). This restriction ensures that each unique Player, residing within a single household or utilizing a specific computer and IP address, can redeem the bonus
                                    offer only once. This policy is in place to maintain the fairness and integrity of the bonus system, preventing multiple claims from the same individual or shared environments. It is important to note that attempting to redeem
                                    the bonus offer multiple times from the same Account or shared locations may result in the forfeiture of bonus privileges and could lead to further account-related actions in accordance with Tonybet's T&amp;Cs.</p>
                                <p>3.1.2.1 Each player is responsible for safeguarding their login credentials. Sharing account credentials and devices is strictly prohibited according to the T&amp;Cs. No third party, including friends and relatives, is allowed to utilize
                                    Your Account or access the website using Your username. If any player suspects that the security of their account has been compromised, they should promptly notify Tonybet. Tonybet disclaims any responsibility for actions taken
                                    by a third party who gains unauthorized access to a player's account. In no event will Tonybet be held liable for losses incurred by a player due to mishandling of their access credentials by any individual. All transactions and

                                    from a warning to permanent account closure and the forfeiture of the balance.</p>

                                    by a group of people, then it may withdraw the availability of any offer, or all offers to that customer or group of customers and/or void any bet funded by the bonus or offer and remove any winnings from such bet.</p>
                                <p>3.1.3. Subject to the T&amp;Cs of a specific promotion or bonus offer, where the Player is offered a bonus by Tonybet and the Player is required to make a deposit to claim the bonus, the Player must wager the value of their qualifying
                                    deposit before being entitled to withdraw any winnings related to the bonus. Tonybet has a right to revoke the bonus and refund the remaining balance should the Player be in breach of the T&amp;Cs.</p>

                                <p>3.1.4. As per the bonus terms, customers can use their deposited funds without following the bonus terms, unless specified otherwise. Winnings from a bonus are considered as such, and payouts will only happen once the bonus terms are

                                <p>3.1.8. The Operator shall reserve the right to amend bonus terms and conditions at its own discretion at any time. Prior notice would be given on the Website.</p>
                                <p>3.1.9. If these bonus terms are breached or there is evidence that a customer or a group of customers have made a series of bets that, due to a bonus, increased earnings, bets or other offers, guarantees a profit for the customer,
                                    whether individually or part of a group, no matter what the results, the Operator reserves the right to withdraw the bonus portion of the bonus offers and to settle the bets at the correct odds, or to cancel the bets and the bets

                                <p>10.9. If the Player does not agree with the response received in the deadlock letter, they may lodge a complaint against the Operator with iGO.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>10.10. Subject to the Customer Care and Dispute Resolution (“CCDR”) Program of iGaming Ontario, the Operator irrevocably attorns to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario. The CCDR Program will not apply
                                    to complaints that relate to the interpretation or application of applicable law or the actions or inactions of any governmental authority.</p>
                                <p>10.11. All Player Disputes shall be adjudicated in accordance with Ontario law.</p>
                                <p>10.12. The Operator strives to ensure the full protection of all its clients and their bets; however, there are certain events that are beyond our control. If for any reason, the customer is disconnected from the game server, the Operator
                                    cannot be held liable for any losses that may result from this disconnection. The Operator will undertake the best endeavors in ensuring that the balance of the customer’s account is recorded on the server and is not affected by
                                    the disconnection in any way. If a line has been disconnected or become unresponsive, when the customer logs on the balance of credits recorded on the server after the last bet was completed, is displayed. By placing any further
                                    wagers, the customer accepts the results of any previous wager. As such, at the Operator’s discretion, the results of the previous wager are no longer in dispute and no refunds or other adjustments will be granted. If the customer
                                    feels the result of any of the games is unfair or incorrect, they should contact customer support immediately and report the discrepancy providing a detailed description of the bet or round affected.</p>
                                <p>10.13. Our Support team is available for you any time 24/7 at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@tonybet.ca">info@tonybet.ca</a></p>
                                <p>10.14. In case you are aware of any collusion, cheating or fraudulence activity and wish to report it. Please, contact customer support via Live Chat or E-mail.</p>
