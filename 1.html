    <p>From time to time, Ligtip Limited may disclose personal information to Companies within the Group and other affiliated companies, service providers or vendors acting on its behalf to enable them to perform specific types of processing and other specialized
        services.</p>
    <p>For example, Ligtip Limited may partner with third parties to offer contest entrants a prize, and those third parties may require personal information in order to deliver that prize to the rightful contest winners. Service providers and vendors may
